Sort tasks by due dates (ascending/descending).
3. Batch Actions
Perform batch actions on tasks, such as:
Delete multiple tasks at once.
Mark multiple tasks as complete.
4. Task History and Activity Log
Track changes made to tasks (e.g., creation, edits, deletions) and display an activity log for each task.
5. File Attachments
